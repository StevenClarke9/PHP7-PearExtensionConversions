# PHP7-PearExtensionConversions

Convert PHP Pear Extensions to PHP 7 syntax in order to stop Deprecated Notice Messages.

# Software Development

On this internet site I plan to show some of my skills in software development.

# Philosophy

On the subject of Software Development I am agnostic to the use of any particular framework, library or programming language. I am also not interrested in any of the flame wars critizing a platform, programming language, framework, libraries or tools.

I consider myself as a programming language polygot, Because I am only interrested in weather a programming language and its Library Frameworks can be used to create the result that I want.

I follow these steps to solve programming problems.

1. Command. Is there a system command that can solve the problem.

2. Scripting. Can the selected commands be combined into a command script. This script is composed of sequential commands and can include piping and redirection. The script can also accept arguments.

3. Utilise Advanced Scripting Constructs. Do I have to use script constructs such as "If", "For", "While", "Case", "Do Done" to solve the problem.

4. Implement in a Scripting Language. Can I use the dynamic Scripting Languages to implement a programme to solve the problem or a step to solve the problem.

I will use PHP, Perl or Python to implement a programme. I have also experimented with using Erlang, Guile (a dialect of Scheme which is derived from Common Lisp), and PicoLisp.

5. Implement in C++. if the programme is executing slowly because it is implemented in an interpreted language, then I will implement the programme in C++.

If I get stuck and I am not progressing I will endeavor to consult with my team mates. 

I then will ask "Dr Google" to find a website where another "Software Professional" has pasted a solution to a similar problem.

I have found that "Source Overflow" and "The Code Project" websites are very usefull.

Any code snippets are adjusted for my project environment. The code is implemented into a seperate programme or script outside of my project tree.

The code is then tested for the correct results, before the code is integerated into the current project.

If the code is useful then I will implement a generic method that can be used in additional projects.
